=================
This is my own interpretation of the Trekv2 Watchface for Pebble.
(https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-trekv2)

Things that I changed:
* Display both F and C temperatures
* I use 24h display and don't care about colons.
* Remove '24h' label from top corner
* Change date format to: %Y%j %m%d
* Make battery squares have an 'empty' square for squares above current charge level
